# Spare part prj

In this project we try to have a continues loop where we keep asking for user input untill the correct user input has been supplied.
The prj is case sensitive and therefor a bit hard to type the right thing if not focused.
We have 5 specific cases that the user can activate
We have 3 parts specific cases
and 2 queries for parts list and parts count. This is where help can be found if something wierd is typed.
We use for loops, while loops, fgets, arrays of strings, tenary operator as the new learning themes. I think i got away with quite a fine rendidtion of the new learning points.
except i did not use auto for any of my data types, as i find this boring.
